# Cargo_Shipment
Project on Full Stack

Overview:

The Cargo Shipment System is a full-stack application designed to calculate and optimize the transportation costs of cargo via trains and ships. It categorizes cargo as non-hazardous, hazardous, refrigerated, or heavy-duty and assigns it to the most cost-effective and suitable transport mode. This project aims to streamline logistics by providing an intuitive interface for users to input shipment details and view results.

Features:

Dynamic Shipping and Train Selection: Automatically selects the appropriate mode of transportation based on cargo category and cost-effectiveness.
Cost Calculation: Calculates total transportation cost, including additional charges for hazardous materials, refrigerated cargo, and excess weight.
Real-Time Query Processing: Fetches data from a PostgreSQL database for trains, ships, and their locations.
Category-Specific Rules: Supports different calculation logic for non-hazardous, hazardous, refrigerated, and heavy-duty cargo.
Frontend with EJS: Dynamic rendering of pages based on user inputs, using Embedded JavaScript (EJS).
Backend with Node.js: Efficient and scalable backend for data processing and logic implementation.
Database Integration: Utilizes PostgreSQL for storing and retrieving data related to trains, ships, and locations.
